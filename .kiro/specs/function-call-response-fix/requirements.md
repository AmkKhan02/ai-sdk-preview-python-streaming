# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The chat API is experiencing a critical error when users ask follow-up questions after initial analytical queries. The error "Please ensure that the number of function response parts is equal to the number of function call parts" occurs because there's a mismatch in how function calls and their responses are being handled when communicating with the Gemini API. This prevents users from asking follow-up questions about their data analysis, breaking the conversational flow.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user asking follow-up questions about my data analysis, I want the system to handle function calls correctly so that I can continue my analytical conversation without errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user asks a follow-up question that triggers a function call THEN the system SHALL properly match function call parts with function response parts
2. WHEN function responses are sent back to the Gemini model THEN the system SHALL ensure the correct format and structure to prevent API errors
3. WHEN multiple function calls are made in a single request THEN the system SHALL handle all responses correctly without causing mismatches

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want the analytical query system to work reliably for both initial questions and follow-up questions so that I can have a complete analytical conversation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I ask an initial analytical question THEN the system SHALL execute the function call and return results correctly
2. WHEN I ask a follow-up question using the same session THEN the system SHALL maintain context and execute subsequent function calls without errors
3. WHEN function calls fail or succeed THEN the system SHALL handle both cases gracefully without breaking the response flow

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the function call handling to be robust and debuggable so that I can maintain and troubleshoot the system effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN function calls are processed THEN the system SHALL log appropriate debug information for troubleshooting
2. WHEN errors occur in function call handling THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and maintain system stability
3. WHEN function responses are formatted THEN the system SHALL ensure they match Gemini's expected format exactly
