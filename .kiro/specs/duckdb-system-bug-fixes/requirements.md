# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The DuckDB Analysis System has three critical issues that are preventing users from having a smooth analytical experience. Users are seeing raw JSON responses instead of clean text, follow-up questions are failing with HTTP 400 errors, and database functions are failing during execution. These issues must be resolved to provide a reliable analytical chat interface.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user asking analytical questions, I want to see only clean, readable text responses so that I can focus on the analysis without being distracted by technical JSON structures.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system generates a response THEN the user SHALL see only the content from the "answer" key in clean text format
2. WHEN a response is returned THEN the user SHALL NOT see any JSON structure, curly braces, success flags, or session IDs
3. WHEN the system processes the response internally THEN it SHALL handle JSON structure internally without exposing it to the user
4. WHEN text is returned to the user THEN there SHALL be no duplication of content

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user asking follow-up questions about my data analysis, I want the system to maintain session context and handle function calls correctly so that I can continue my analytical conversation without errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user asks a follow-up question THEN the system SHALL NOT return HTTP 400 errors about function response parts
2. WHEN function calls are made THEN the system SHALL ensure proper pairing between function calls and responses
3. WHEN a session is active THEN the database connection SHALL persist across requests within the same session
4. WHEN multiple function calls are made THEN each call SHALL have exactly one corresponding response
5. WHEN session state is maintained THEN follow-up questions SHALL have access to previous context

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user performing data analysis, I want all database functions to execute successfully so that I can get accurate analytical results including time calculations and date operations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN database functions are called THEN they SHALL execute without "database function error" messages
2. WHEN time metrics are calculated THEN date/time calculations SHALL work properly with timestamps
3. WHEN SQL queries are executed THEN all DuckDB functions SHALL work correctly
4. WHEN database operations are performed THEN they SHALL complete successfully without breaking the response flow
5. WHEN time difference calculations are needed THEN the system SHALL handle timestamp operations correctly

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the system, I want robust error handling and session management so that the system remains stable and debuggable across multiple user sessions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN database connections are needed THEN the system SHALL create and maintain persistent connections per session
2. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL handle them gracefully without breaking the user experience
3. WHEN multiple users are active THEN session isolation SHALL work properly
4. WHEN debugging is needed THEN the system SHALL provide clear logging for function calls and responses
5. WHEN connection errors occur THEN the system SHALL handle them gracefully and attempt recovery
