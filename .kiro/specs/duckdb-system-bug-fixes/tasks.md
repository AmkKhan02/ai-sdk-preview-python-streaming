# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Fix response format to return only clean text to users





  - Modify the `/api/analyze-duckdb` endpoint to extract and return only the answer content
  - Update response handling to never expose JSON structure to users
  - Ensure no text duplication occurs in user-visible responses
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4_

- [ ] 2. Implement response extraction utility function




  - Create helper function to extract clean text from internal JSON responses
  - Add fallback handling for malformed response structures
  - Ensure function handles various response formats gracefully
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.3_

- [ ] 3. Fix function call response consolidation in stream_text
  - Modify function response collection to properly consolidate all responses
  - Ensure consolidated response structure matches Gemini's expected format
  - Fix the function call/response mismatch causing HTTP 400 errors
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 2.4_

- [ ] 4. Enhance database session connection management
  - Implement robust connection handling with health checks and retry logic
  - Add connection persistence across requests within the same session
  - Implement automatic reconnection for dropped connections
  - _Requirements: 2.3, 2.5, 4.1, 4.2_

- [ ] 5. Fix database function execution errors
  - Add retry logic for failed database function calls
  - Implement specific fixes for time calculation and date operation errors
  - Add proper error handling for DuckDB function failures
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4, 3.5_

- [ ] 6. Improve session state management and isolation
  - Enhance session manager to properly isolate sessions between users
  - Implement session cleanup and resource management
  - Add session health monitoring and automatic cleanup
  - _Requirements: 4.3, 4.4, 4.5_

- [ ] 7. Add comprehensive error handling and logging
  - Implement detailed logging for function calls and database operations
  - Add error categorization and user-friendly error messages
  - Ensure all errors are handled gracefully without breaking user experience
  - _Requirements: 4.4, 4.5_

- [ ] 8. Create unit tests for response format extraction
  - Write tests for clean text extraction from various response formats
  - Test error handling when response structure is malformed
  - Verify no JSON structure is ever returned to users
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3_

- [ ] 9. Create integration tests for follow-up question flow
  - Test complete flow from initial question to follow-up without HTTP 400 errors
  - Verify session persistence and context maintenance
  - Test function call consolidation with multiple function calls
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4, 2.5_

- [ ] 10. Create tests for database function reliability
  - Test time calculations and date operations work correctly
  - Test retry logic for failed database functions
  - Verify all DuckDB functions execute successfully
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4, 3.5_
